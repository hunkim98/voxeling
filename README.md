# Voxeling: A new interface for editing 3D voxels with 2D planes

Different from 2D editting tools, it is very difficult to edit 3D voxels with a 2D screen. Since there is a limit in interaction due to the 2D screen, it is hard to edit 3D voxels intuitively. In this project, we propose a new interface for editing 3D voxels with 2D planes. The proposed interface is based on the idea of a 2D plane that corresponds to a certain floor in a 3D voxel space. In addition to the original 3D voxel edit interface where a voxel is created based on the user's click position, we also provide users to intuitively fill out a certain floor using a 2D interface.

This project was built with React Three Fiber.
